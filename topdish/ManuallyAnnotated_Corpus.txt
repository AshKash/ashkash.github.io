<Staff><Negative><0> I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong , it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent ! ! </0></Negative></Staff>
<Staff><Negative><1> The service was terrible , we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served . </1></Negative></Staff>
<Staff><Negative><2> The waitress , seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing . </2></Negative></Staff>
<Anecdotes><Negative><3> After dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend , asked him : Where are you from ...maybe you dont know how things work in America ...and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on . </3></Negative></Anecdotes>
<Anecdotes><Negative><4> We did tip , I guess the model just wanted more and complained to the manager . </4></Negative></Anecdotes>
<Staff><Negative><5> The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff , because despite the current one this is a great place . </5></Negative></Staff>

<Miscellaneous><Positive><0> One of the more authentic Shanghainese restaurants in the US definitely the best in Manhattan Chinatown . </0></Positive></Miscellaneous>
<Ambience><Negative><1> Was reading other reviews and thought -- if all you order is chow fun then of course it 's greasy and awful ( and not even Shanghainese ) ... agreed , the ambience is lacking . </1></Negative></Ambience>
<Food><Positive><2> But the traditional items -- yellow eel , eggplant , mock chicken , fried juicy buns , etc . ( which most tourists do n't order ) -- are prepared with traditional flavor , harboring a semi-sweet , juicy taste . </2></Positive></Food>
<Miscellaneous><Neutral><3> Yeah Shanghai is also great but not quite as good -- they use the same amount of salt but without sweetness to balance out . </3></Neutral></Miscellaneous>

<Food><Positive><3> And the soup bombs here , lovingly called Pork Dumplings with Soup ( ha ! ) are an experiance . </3></Positive></Food>
<Food><Positive><4> Wonton dough filled with gently steamed and seasoned pork are common but add this amazing soup to the wonton , seal it and serve it steaming hot and the dumpling becomes new again ...this place is amazing for those dumplings alone but try the wine chicken and the scallion pancakes as well . </4></Positive></Food>

<Staff><Positive><0> I 've been a fan of Pastis for years it never fails to succeed in producing wonderfully friendly , knowledgeable servers ( I miss Eva n ! ) and top-notch French bistro fare . </0></Positive></Staff>
<Food><Positive><1> The wine selection ( by the glass and bottle ) is wonderful and I always recommend that friends make a reservation if they 're going to be in town . </1></Positive></Food>
<Miscellaneous><Neutral><2> It saves walking in and waiting for a table in the often noisy , crowded bar at dinnertime . </2></Neutral></Miscellaneous>
<Miscellaneous><Positive><3> This is definitely a place that provides the best experience , though , to both A-listers and people walking in off the street . </3></Positive></Miscellaneous>

<Miscellaneous><Positive><1> And where does Patis go wrong ; no where. </1></Positive></Miscellaneous>

<Food><Negative><0> Do not get the Go Go Hamburgers , no matter what the reviews say . </0></Negative></Food>
<Food><Price><Negative><1> They were such a rip-off ( $ 8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns ) and not worth trying . </1></Negative></Price></Food>

<Ambience><Positive><4> The wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek ( for Chinatown ) alternative . </4></Positive></Ambience>
<Food><Negative><5> A few tips : skip the turnip cake , roast pork buns and egg custards . </5></Negative></Food>
<Food><Price><Negative><6> These are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner : ( 1 ) turnip cakes at the little kiosk on east side of Mott St. just south of bayard ( 2 ) egg custards and pork buns at either bakery on west side of Mott street just south of Canal . </6></Negative></Price></Food>

<Food><Positive><0> - the bread at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more - the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes , however be warned that the Peter 's Favourite pizza with prosciutto and baby arugula is actually a margarite pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top , like a salad . </0></Positive></Food>
<Food><Conflict><1> It was good , but was not what I thought it would be . </1></Conflict></Food>
