<p>I'm an educated fool<br>
So I don't know what it is I'm supposed to do<br>
About this awkward situation<br>
That's been forced down right upon me</p>
<p>As I'm walking down into on my own<br>
into the valley of life<br>
Got a lifetime of experience<br>
yeah I've got so much to give</p>
<p>Open the page at chapter one<br>
could this just be that life's just begun<br>
Forever within your darker thoughts<br>
Reflecting on everything you've been taught</p>
<p>Never felt this way before<br>
Seems that somebody's just opened the door<br>
To the book of life... or is it death!<br>
there's ever anyway out</p>
<p>Someone's looking down on me<br>
to the very inner core of my soul<br>
They won't tell me what they see<br>
But I really want to know</p>
<p>I want to leave my life on my own<br>
I want to lift the unturned stone<br>
I want to walk right into the fire<br>
I want to live out all my desires</p>
<p>I want to go and see the fire burn<br>
I want to see and feel my world turn<br>
I want to know what more there's to learn<br>
I want to pass the point of no return</p>
<p>Do you really wanna be<br>
Just another one statistic or feel</p>
<p>That you really should aspire<br>
That you really do deserve more</p>
<p>Do you ever really feel<br>
That you have so much potential inside<br>
What you really have to give<br>
Could be realized so much more</p>
<p>Time will flow<br>
And I will follow<br>
Time will go<br>
But I will follow</p>
<p>I want to feel what life's like respond<br>
I want to meet my father beyond<br>
I want to walk right into the light<br>
I want to feel no fear but delight</p>
<p>I want to leave my life on my own<br>
I want to lift the unturned stone<br>
I want to walk right into the fire<br>
I want to live out all my desires</p>

As the ground warms to the first rays of light<br>
A birdsong shatters the still<br>

His eyes are ablaze<br>
See the madman in his gaze<br>

Fly on your way like an eagle<br>
Fly as high as the sun<br>
On your wings like an eagle<br>
Fly and touch the sun<br>

Now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears<br>
Look the old man in his eyes<br>
As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd<br>
In the name of God my father I fly<br>

His eyes seem so glazed<br>
As he flies on the wings of a dream<br>
Now he knows his father betrayed<br>
Now his wings burn to ashes to ashes his grave<br>

Fly and touch the sun<br>

So when your waiting for the next attack<br>
You'd better stand there's no turning back<br>

The Bugle sounds as the charge begins<br>
But on this battlefield no one wins<br>
The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath<br>
As you plunge into a certain death<br>
<br>
The horse he sweats with fear we break to run<br>
The mighty roar of the Russian guns<br>
And as we race towards the human wall<br>
The screams of pain as my comrades fall<br>
<br>
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground<br>
And the Russians fire another round<br>
We get so near yet so far away<br>
We won't live to fight another day<br>
<br>
We get so close near enough to fight<br>
When a Russian gets me in his sights<br>
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow<br>
A burst of rounds take my horse below<br>
<br>
And as I lay there gazing at the sky<br>
My body's numb and my throat is dry<br>
And as I lay forgotten and alone<br>
Without a tear I draw my parting groan</p>

<p>The main reason this exists on my page is coz IM based one of their songs on
this (Charlotte the Harlot??)</p>
<p>HAD we but world enough, and time,<br>
This coyness, Lady, were no crime<br>
We would sit down and think which way<br>
To walk and pass our long love's day.<br>
Thou by the Indian Ganges' side<br>
Shouldst rubies find: I by the tide<br>
Of Humber would complain. I would<br>
Love you ten years before the Flood,<br>
And you should, if you please, refuse<br>
Till the conversion of the Jews.<br>
My vegetable love should grow<br>
Vaster than empires, and more slow;<br>
An hundred years should go to praise<br>
Thine eyes and on thy forehead gaze;<br>
Two hundred to adore each breast,<br>
But thirty thousand to the rest;<br>
An age at least to every part,<br>
And the last age should show your heart.<br>
For, Lady, you deserve this state,<br>
Nor would I love at lower rate.<br>
But at my back I always hear<br>
Time's wingèd chariot hurrying near;<br>
And yonder all before us lie<br>
Deserts of vast eternity.<br>
Thy beauty shall no more be found,<br>
Nor, in thy marble vault, shall sound<br>
My echoing song: then worms shall try<br>
That long preserved virginity,<br>
And your quaint honour turn to dust,<br>
And into ashes all my lust:<br>
The grave 's a fine and private place,<br>
But none, I think, do there embrace.<br>
Now therefore, while the youthful hue<br>
Sits on thy skin like morning dew,<br>
And while thy willing soul transpires<br>
At every pore with instant fires,<br>
Now let us sport us while we may,<br>
And now, like amorous birds of prey,<br>
Rather at once our time devour<br>
Than languish in his slow-chapt power.<br>
Let us roll all our strength and all<br>
Our sweetness up into one ball,<br>
And tear our pleasures with rough strife<br>
Thorough the iron gates of life:<br>
Thus, though we cannot make our sun<br>
Stand still, yet we will make him run.</p>

Dust to dust<br>
Fade to black</p>
<p>Fortune, fame<br>
Mirror vain<br>
Gone insane...<br>
Fortune, fame<br>
Mirror vain<br>
Gone insane...<br>
But the memory remains<br>
Ash to ash Dust to dust Fade to black...<br>
But the memory remains Yeah<br>
Faded prima donna yeah, yeah (solo)<br>
Dance little tin goddess dance</p>

<p>Lights out - We live in a world of darkness<br>
No doubt - Everything's up for sale<br>
We sleep - All of the world is burning<br>
We pray - To god for a better deal<br>
Nothing is sacred - Back then or now<br>
Everything's wasted...<br>
Is that all there is?<br>
Can I go now?</p>
<p>Judas my guide<br>
Whispers in the night<br>
Judas my guide</p>
<p>Fight wars - Die in a blaze of glory<br>
Come home - Meat in a plastic sack<br>
Fall down - Better pray to your God for mercy<br>
So kneel - and help the blade cut clean<br>
Nothing is sacred - Back then or now<br>
Everyone's wasted...<br>
Is that all there is?<br>
Is that it now?</p>
<p>I live in the black<br>
I have no guiding light<br>
I'm whispering in your dreams...</p>
<p>Judas my guide<br>
Whispers in the night<br>
Judas my guide</p>
<p>Judas my guide<br>
Whispers in the night<br>
Judas my guide</p>
