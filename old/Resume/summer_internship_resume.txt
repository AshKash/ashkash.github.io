Research Assistant
------------------

I am a student in the ECE department; I have received a research 
assistantship in the Dataman Lab (http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/dataman). 
Our focus is in wireless sensor networks, mobile computing and 
peer-to-peer systems. 
 
These are some of the projects I have worked on: 
 
Implemented a gateway between sensor networks and the Internet. 
Using my framework, computers on the Internet can seamlessly 
communicate with sensor networks. We used TinyOS running on Rene 
motes on the sensor network. 
 
OS Project: User Level Threads on Solaris, Replicated Filesystem 
and cache-affine, multiple run queue Linux scheduler. 
 
Software Engineering Project: Real-time duplex voice 
communications using JMF. 
 
Communications Network: Simulated protocols like BGP, Multicasting 
using a Java framework. 
 
Computer Networks: Designed and implemented a peer-to-peer web 
server, using the Chord API. Our idea was to enable mobile users 
to seamlessly query and download information in mobile networks 
based on location.
