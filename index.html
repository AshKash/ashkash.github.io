<h1>About</h1>
<hr>
<p>I graduated in 2003 from <a href="http://www.rutgers.edu">Rutgers</a> with a
Masters degree in <a href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu">Computer Science</a>
I worked with <a href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~badri">Prof. Badri</a> as
a graduate research assistant. My <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/cybernytrix">
LinkedIn profile</a>.

<h1>Projects past...</h1>
<hr>
<p>Some ideas / projects, some half-backed, some nostalgic that I have worked on.
</p>

<h2><a href="ajaxcrypt/index.html">AjaxCrypt</a></h2>
<p>
AjaxCrypt is a Javascript based proof of concept alternative to HTTPS. 
It uses a combination of AJAX requests, HTTPS and window.postMessage() to implement a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">man-in-the-middle</a> 
resistant alternative to HTTPS. 
<a href="ajaxcrypt/index.html">Click here</a> for more information.
</p>

<h2><a href="kab/index.html">Stop AD Blocking</a></h2>
<p>
Proof of concept to prevent use of <a href="http://adblockplus.org/en/">AdBlock Plus</a>.
The idea is to encrypt page contents which can only be decrypted with a secret 
key sent with the AD. In order for this to work you (unfortunately) need support 
from your AD provider. 
Click <a href="kab/index.html">here</a> for demo and more information.
</p>

<h2><a href="putty/">Putty patches</a></h2>
<p>
I use <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a> and 
<a href="http://winscp.net/eng/index.php">WinSCP</a>, one thing I really miss
is to be able to open WinSCP from the current PuTTY sesion. I patched PuTTY to
implement this feature, you can download the <a href="putty/">code here</a>.
</p>

<h2><a href="misc_projs/ebt_vnat.html">ebt_vnat patches</a></h2>
<p>
This is totally experimental! This module will add a VLAN tag to
wireless packets based on the SSID it was received on. I submitted this
as patches to ebtables for Linux 2.4. You might have to
do some porting to make it work again.
</p>

<h2><a href="misc_projs/tbf.pdf">Trajectory Based Forwarding</a></h2>
<p>Trajectory Based Forwarding is a new routing protocol for
sensor networks. The nodes in the network are assumed to be location aware and
all packets carry an encoded "trajectory" that describes the path the
packet must follow. Some obvious advantages are decoupling the node id
from the path, which is good for mobile networks. You can read the
paper <a href="http://www.research.rutgers.edu/~dnicules/research/tbf/tbftr.pdf">
here</a>. Andrew, Mike and me implemented this on Berkeley Motes
running <a href="http://www.tinyos.net/">TinyOS</a>. You can read the 
<a href="misc_projs/tbf.pdf">report</a> or <a href="misc_projs/tbf.tgz">
download</a> the code [.tgz].
</p>

<h2>Adhoc Positioning System</h2>
<p>
Ad hoc Positioning System is a new algorithm to enable Motes to know
about their geographic location without using GPS. You can read about
the paper <a href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~dnicules/research/aps/aps.html">here</a>.
I have implemented one of these protocols on the Motes.
I also designed and implemented a querying protocol which basically
enables us to get/set the protocol state on the Mote. There is also a
nice <a href="misc_projs/aps-demo.gif">
TCL/TK GUI</a> that maps out the given sensor field in 2D and it is
possible to graphically query different properties of each node in the
sensor field. <a href="misc_projs/aps-demo.tgz">Download</a> the code [.tgz].
</p>

<h2>SLIP Simulator</h2>
<p>
Slip Simulator - Motes can be emulated in software and its UART can be
accessed via a socket. We also have a working UDP/IP stack for the
Motes. While developing protocols, it is useful to have some sort of a
simulation framework. Slip simulator does this. Basically, it does FD
forwarding between a socket and TTY-pair, one side of which is attached
to the SLIP protocol using slattach. 
<a href="misc_projs/slip_sim.tgz">Download</a> the code [.tgz].
</p>

<h2>Colored range searching</h2>
<p>
Interesting DB project - colored range searching is a problem that arises 
in spatial databases, network routing, document retrieval, and sub-string indexing.
You can read the full <a href="db_project/Report.pdf">report</a> (PDF) or
<a href="db_project/db_proj.tgz">download</a> the code to re-run the experiments. 
</p>

<h2>OS project code</h2>
<p>
Some naive old code I wrote for the OS course to implement networked file systems.
<a href="misc_projs/rfs2.tgz">Download</a> the code here.
</p>

<h2>Mote Gateway</h2>
<p>
This was my maiden project at <a href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~badri/dataman/">
The Dataman Lab</a>! Motes are tiny
wireless devices with sensors, you can find more information about motes are the
<a href="http://www.tinyos.net/">Berkeley TinyOS</a> website. 
This project enables multiple clients to query a Sensor network over the internet.
<a href="misc_projs/mote-gw.tgz">Download</a> the code [.tgz].
</p>

<h2>Mp3Spider</h2>
<p>
<a href="old/free_software/mp3Spider/index.html">mp3Spider</a> 
is a Java based crawler, which crawls all shared files in a
windows network, I wrote it so that I can search for mp3 files in my
office network. </p>

We shall go on to the end,
we shall fight in France,
we shall fight on the seas
and the oceans,
we shall fight with growing confidence 
and growing strength in the air,
we shall defend our Island,
whatever the cost may be,
we shall fight on the beaches,
we shall fight on the landing grounds,
we shall fight in the fields
and in the streets,
we shall fight in the hills;
we shall never surrender
